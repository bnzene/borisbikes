write down type of error: NameError - uninitialized constant
file path where error happened: users/eleanorkavanagh-brown/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.3.3/bin/irb:11:in ` <main>`
error line number: 1
understand error with ruby docs - nameerror as class DockingStation undefined
find a way to solve it: initialize constant (create DockingStation class before initializing it)
